## Credits

As this project is a remake of the initial portfolio, I have used and adapted code from the initial portfolio (URL of the deployed application: https://pedrobe9.github.io/pedrobe-portfolio/        URL of the GitHub repository that contains your code: https://github.com/Pedrobe9/pedrobe-portfolio).
I have used the website for Bootstrap as guidance and information source (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/).
